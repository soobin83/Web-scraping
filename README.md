# Web-scraping
This is Module 11 challenge.
First, part_1_mars_news.ipynb has title and preview texts from Mars News site.
Secondly, part_2_mars_weather.ipynb shows the data scraped from Mars weather data, and it shows analysis as well as graphs. Finally, the data was exported to a csv file, and saved under mars_data_csv.
